                            As we said earlier, domestic tourism allows keeping a level of villas occupancy high. The number of Indonesians coming to Bali had increased several times over. According to Indonesia's Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno, the influx of domestic tourists in Bali doubled in April.

                        <p class="accordion__text">(https://www.indo-ned.com/news/bali-domestic-tourism-increases-to-4500-visitors-every-day-in-april) </p>

                        <p class="accordion__text">By the way, despite the current travel restrictions, visitors with business visas (and some other types) can enter the country. Moreover, Sandiago Uno says digital nomads will be granted 5-year visas with no taxes on foreign-sourced income. That will provide a new flow of remote workers to Bali. According to Gartner research, the number of remote employees will come to 51% by the end of 2021. In the near future, Bali can become the next Digital Technology Hub.</p>

Second, you need to get initial permissions and a license for building a villa. Third, this process requires a detailed plan and a large group of professionals. It is necessary to take into account many technical moments regarding the legal and building aspects. There is a strong chance you’ll be wasting your money and time if you have no experience in this area. We are familiar with many instances when people could not finish the building process due to issues that have to do with the processes we described. </p>
